### Hi, I'm Nobu.
I'm a software developer...

Unfortunately, I can't brag about being an Amiga or Commodore64 wizard as a kid. But, I was a humble Encarta 97' enjoyer :joy:  
Back then, I spent hours in front of the family PC. I still spend a lot of time on my computer, but at least I'm conscious about it now. Some things never change...  right?   
<br />

*Until they do.*  

To be continued :arrow_right:  

### What am I up to now?
 - I'm currently learning Rust and Substrate framework. :crab: Check my [Kitties](https://github.com/nobuyoshiAquino/ic-kitties) repository and my [notes](https://github.com/nobuyoshiAquino/ic-kitties/blob/main/my-notes.md) on building this project.  
 - I'm interested in learning about the fundamentals of blockchain. So I thought it would be a nice chance to write my first post about it. "*Learn through teaching*".  
 - I'm re-learning math with Brilliant. :game_die:
