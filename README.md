### Hi, I'm Nobu.

I'm a software developer who likes simple programs.  

I constantly had to remind myself that computers and programs are tools.  
They should help us in our daily tasks and enhance our quality of life: *nothing more, nothing less*.  
But sometimes, it's just hard to go outside and enjoy the rest of the day when there are so many things to discover in the vast sea of the Internet. :boat:  

### What am I up to now?
 - I'm currently learning Rust and Substrate framework. :crab: Check my [Kitties](https://github.com/nobuyoshiAquino/ic-kitties) repository and my [notes](https://github.com/nobuyoshiAquino/ic-kitties/blob/main/my-notes.md) on building this project.  
 - I'm interested in learning about the fundamentals of blockchain. So I thought it would be a nice chance to write my first post about it. "*Learn through teaching*".  
 - I'm re-learning math with Brilliant. :game_die:
